##  Why This Project?

First of all, and as it says in the description, it's a Hands-on implementation of a Speech-to-Text Model "Vosk" with integrated grammar checking for enhanced usability
Living in areas with unstable internet (like Syria), I wanted to learn, experience and build something useful that doesn't rely on online services.  
This app helps me deal with audio model, and convert speech to text and correct grammar locally — and eventually, I hope to build my own models and share them freely via Telegram bots.
